# Changes Description

In this HW, I decided to make a slider/slideshow on the project section of my portfolio. To achieve this, I made some modifications slightly on the HTML file e.g., added new elements and class namings, and also the overall styling in the CSS file e.g., the way the project card displayed as a stack of "slides". The slider operates as follows:
- Click on either buttons to proceed or go back to previous slides (allows wrap around) to go to the desired project card
- Click on the slide number to go to the desired project card

I also preserved the previous styling, i.e., normal scrolling to the bottom layout in case JavaScript is not supported in the user's browser or if it is disabled.

As far as third parrty script, I got inspired by one of the examples mentioned in the assignment description, which is adding a Google Analytics' script to my page. The reason I added this is to be more familiar with insights web tracking and such, in particular the specific actions that are being displayed in the analysis summary.
