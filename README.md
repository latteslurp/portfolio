# Changes Description

## HW 5
While the Lighthouse report indicates no major issue in any of the metrics that are being used to measure overall score of site performance (with an average score above 90), I try to adapt further imporvements to improve upon it. These includes the following:

- Performance (previous: 92, current best: 100)
    - Convert a jpeg image to webp
    - Set explicit width and height to image elements
- Accessibilty (previous: 88, current best: 100)
    - Change color of experience card title p element
    - Change heading in home, about, and projects sections
- SEO (previous: 92, current best: 100)
    - Added meta description to index.html
    - Change slider arrows on project slides from a to span element

I also made some changes/adjustments to the design (beyond what mentioned above), and they are the following:
- Text color change to h3 elements on about and projects sections 
- Change background colors of home and experience sections
- Different sizing of profile picture in about section
- Change background color of sliders in projects section (project cards, arrows, slide numbers)
- Further djust width in projects section to make it fit better in different devices
- Animation on mobile view nav and toggle to close drop down on click
- Some modification in about me content
